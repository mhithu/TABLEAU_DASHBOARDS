## Installation :wrench:

These dashboards are created in Tableau and can be viewed using Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop. To run these dashboards on your local machine:

1. Install Tableau Public/Desktop from [Tableau's official website](https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop)
2. Clone this repository to your local machine

3. Open the `.twb` or `.twbx` files using Tableau

## Project Motivation :bulb:

This project was undertaken to gain insights into the operational aspects of a hypothetical logistics company. The primary objectives were:

1. Understanding the distribution of shipments across different regions.
2. Analyzing shipment volume trends over time.
3. Identifying the most used shipment methods.
4. Highlighting any potential areas of inefficiencies in the operations


## File Descriptions :open_file_folder:

- [`LOGISTICS DASHBOARD.twb`](https://github.com/mhithu/Tableau/blob/main/LOGISTICS%20DASHBOARD.twb): This is the main Tableau workbook file for the logistics dashboard. It connects to the built-in Tableau sample logistics dataset.

## Results :trophy:

The dashboard provides several valuable insights into the logistics operations:

- The West region has the highest number of shipments, suggesting it might be the company's busiest market.
- The volume of shipments has been gradually increasing over time, indicating growth in operations.
- Road is the most frequently used mode of shipment, but it may be worth considering expanding capabilities in Rail and Air for more rapid deliveries.

## Acknowledgements :pray:

This dashboard was created using the Sample - Superstore dataset provided by Tableau.
